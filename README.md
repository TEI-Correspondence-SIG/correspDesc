# correspDesc (correspondence description)

A proposal for a correspondence module and a `correspDesc` element in the Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) by the TEI Correspondence SIG. The proposal was accepted by the TEI Council in 2014 and the elements [`correspDesc`](http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/de/html/ref-correspDesc.html), `correspAction` and `correspContext` were introduced in the version 2.8.0 of the TEI Guidelines in April 2015. For further information see the [Guidelines](http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/de/html/HD.html#HD44CD) or the [jTEI article from Stadler, Illetschko and Seifert](http://journals.openedition.org/jtei/1433). 

## Examples

In the directory ["examples"](./examples), the TEI Correspondence SIG provides multiple use cases of the `correspDesc` element. This section is still maintained. 

## Correspondence Metadata Interchange Format

On the basis of `corresDesc` the TEI Correspondence SIG has been developed the "Correspondence Metadata Interchange Format", which makes a standardized comparison of letter metadata possible. See the GitHub-Repository ["TEI-Corrspondence-SIG/CMIF"](https://github.com/TEI-Correspondence-SIG/CMIF) for further information.
