correspDesc
===========

A proposal for a correspondence module and a correspDesc element.

Starting point is the "[second draft](http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/SIG:Correspondence/ODD_work#Second_draft)" as it was begun at the SIG face-to-face meeting at College Station on November 9, 2012. This draft has been initially commited here as [ffc4899](https://github.com/TEI-Correspondence-SIG/correspDesc/commit/ffc4899833e14eab536062fd1730aa04e7f52949).
