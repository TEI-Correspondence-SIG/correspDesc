                <head>About this document</head>
                <p>This document proposes the addition of a TEI module for correspondence. It is the
                    product of a Correspondence SIG task force (Sabine Seifert, Marcel Illetschko,
                    Peter Stadler<!-- Sabine: Reihenfolge?! -->) with valuable input from various
                    people.</p>
                <p>The aim of the proposal is to define a common set of correspondence-specific meta
                    data, brought together at one place in the TEI header. The lack of special
                    guidelines for encoding letters, postcards, etc. with TEI P5 has been a
                    recurring topic since the formation of the Correspondence SIG in 2008.
                    Additionally, there is a growing demand of correspondence projects for linked
                    data facilities. While some of this correspondence-specific information can
                    already be encoded in various sections of the TEI header we believe it to be of
                    greater value for projects dealing with correspondence material to have this
                    information in one place. For the encoding, we suggest two approaches within
                    this set: <list type="simple">
                        <item>an elaborate structure for detailed data capture,</item>
                        <item>a basic structure for easy data interchange (CIF).</item>
                    </list> A guiding idea has been to only tentatively modify the TEI standard by
                    merely adding a few elements, wrapping them in a special purpose element
                        <gi>ct:correspDesc</gi> and injecting the latter into <gi>sourceDesc</gi>.
                    Please note that <gi>ct:correspDesc</gi> is <emph>not</emph> intended to and can
                        <emph>not</emph> replace the whole TEI header.</p>
                <p>These efforts are supposed to be just a first step in the Correspondence SIG's
                    strive for a complete model of encoding correspondence material.</p>

                <head>Conventions used</head>
                <p>As required for TEI conformance, non-TEI elements are defined in a distinct
                    non-TEI namespace. In the usage examples and throughout this document that
                    namespace is mapped to the prefix <hi rend="bold">ct:</hi> (= correspondence
                    task force), while TEI elements are not marked by any namespace prefix.</p>

                <head>Preceding work</head>
                <p>The development of <gi>ct:correspDesc</gi> was inspired mostly but not
                    exclusively by the work of <ref target="http://www.kantl.be/ctb/project/dalf/">DALF</ref> as well as the <ref target="http://www.weber-gesamtausgabe.de">WeGA</ref>.</p>
                <p>The DALF project, the <emph>Digital Archive of Letters by Flemish Authors and
                        Composers from the 19th &amp; 20th century</emph>, was launched by the
                    Belgian Centre for Scholarly Editing and Document Studies (Centrum voor
                    Teksteditie en Bronnenstudie) and is one of the best documented projects in the
                    area of correspondence encoding. In 2003, specific DTDs and guidelines for the
                    description and encoding of modern correspondence material, both for TEI P4,
                    were published.<ptr target="#dalf-guidelines"/> The practical realization as
                    well as the main features for encoding meta data are discussed in <ptr target="#vanhoutte2009"/>. The DALF guidelines have been reworked for the
                    new requirements in TEI P5 as a “<ref target="http://ctb.kantl.be/project/dalf/P5/DALF_P5-p0.1.zip">Preliminary P5
                        Proposal</ref>” in August 2013 which is an important inspiration for this
                    proposal.</p>
                <p>Before DALF updated its customization from P4 to P5, the
                        <emph>Carl-Maria-von-Weber-Gesamtausgabe</emph> (WeGA, Carl Maria von Weber
                    – Collected Works) had developed project-specific guidelines for encoding
                    correspondence material in TEI P5<ptr target="#wega-guidelines"/> and published
                        <ref target="http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/File:CorrespondenceProposal.zip">recommendations</ref> in June 2011.</p>
                <p>Both projects define a special wrapper element for correspondence meta data while
                    the depth of its structure and its child elements differ slightly. This wrapper
                    element (<gi>DALF:letDesc</gi> and <gi>WEGA:correspDesc</gi>, respectively) is
                    part of the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element. Dalf introduces two child elements:
                    first, <gi>DALF:letHeading</gi> in which they encode the author and addressee of
                    the letter as well as place and date when it was written, and second,
                        <gi>DALF:letDesc</gi> which contains additional information, e.g. formal
                    classification of the letter, presence of an envelope or illustrations. The
                    WEGA, however, groups these information directly within the wrapper element:
                        sender<note place="bottom">In regard to the person who wrote the letter or
                        other piece of correspondence, there is a conceptual difference. Thus, it is
                            <emph>author</emph> in DALF and <emph>sender</emph> in WeGA.</note> and
                    addressee, place and date where and when the letter was not only written but
                    also received, incipit and position within the thread of correspondence
                    (“Korrespondenzstelle”). Both projects decided to leave all other information on
                    providence, physical appearance, history, etc. in <gi>msDesc</gi> where there
                    already are sufficient elements to encode them with. </p>
                <p>In this proposal, we mainly considered the overlapping of these two projects’
                    encoding guidelines and merged them into one.</p>

            <div>
                <head>Theoretical Considerations</head>
                <p>In this document <emph>correspondence</emph> is regarded as an <emph>act of
                        communication</emph>, in which the message of a sender reaches—mediated and
                    time-delayed—an addressee at a different place. Such an act of communication
                    becomes manifest in a <emph>piece of correspondence</emph>, that may be a
                    tangible “object”, characterised by its “materiality” and co-determining the
                    communication, and that is generally related to a medium or process of delivery.
                    Hence, correspondence has a hybrid nature between <emph>event</emph> and
                        <emph>object</emph>.</p>
                <p>As an act of communication is directed at someone, each piece of correspondence
                    has one or more addressees, who may or may not be individually identifiable.
                    Therefore, the scope of "correspondence" in this proposal covers not only
                    letters, postcards, telegrams, and similar "material" pieces of correspondence
                    but also electronic communications, e.g. e-mails and text
                    messages.<!-- =Satz zu Adressatenbezug und scope of correspondence --></p>

                <div>
                    <head>What is—in terms of the TEI—correspondence-specific information?</head>
                    <p>An act of communication has a <emph>sender</emph> of a message
                            (<gi>ct:sender</gi>), who is not necessarily identical to the author of
                        the text of the message.
                        <!--<p> sender and author </p>--></p>
                    <p>An act of communication generally has no unknown audience/unspecified
                        recipient but one or more (intended, maybe even fictional)
                            <emph>addressees</emph> (<gi>ct:addressee</gi>), “spoken” to by the
                        piece of correspondence.</p>
                    <p>A piece of correspondence generally has a certain <emph>time or period of
                            writing</emph> and a definable time of sending—even though it may be
                        unknown or indeterminate
                        (<gi>ct:dateSender</gi>)<!-- Sabine: Hier nennen wir 2 Sachen (Schreiben und Abschicken) für 1 Element, gehen aber 
                            nicht weiter darauf ein. Könnte das verwirren und Nachfragen hervorrufen, was man machte, wenn man beides identifizieren und 
                            einzeln kodieren möchte? Wenn wir das ignorieren: "writing" ist in <emph> und nicht "sending", wobei letzteres aber besser wäre.-->.
                        Similar is true for the <emph>place of writing/sending</emph>
                            (<gi>ct:placeSender</gi>). Both very often is evident in address lines,
                        postmarks, electronically generated sending information, etc.</p>
                    <p>A piece of correspondence generally has a <emph>process/a medium of
                            transfer</emph> (messenger,
                        carrier,
                        postman, carriage, fax machine, internet, etc.)
                        (<gi>ct:transmission</gi>).</p>
                    <p>Very often a particular message is sent in order to trigger an answer (in
                        form of one or more pieces of correspondence). A single piece of
                        correspondence therefore is normally not a secluded entity but a (written)
                        act of communication in a communication continuum<ptr target="#bohnenkamp2013"/><!--(Bohnenkamp/Richter 2013, p.4)-->, in
                        which it is defined by its relative position between messages sent “before”
                        and “after” (<gi>ct:context</gi>).</p>
                    <p>Finally, correspondence may be <emph>categorized</emph> in terms of its
                        object- and/or eventlike nature (e.g. letter, signed personally; telegram;
                        copy; draft) requiring a separate element <gi>ct:correspClass</gi>.</p>
                    <!-- copy/draft etc go into correspClass, c.f. http://www.constance-de-salm.de/fud_docs/DHIParis:2-34CdS-b1-00vt -->
                </div>
                <div>
                    <head>And what is left out?</head>
                    <p>Information concerning the manuscript description, e.g. (postage) stamps,
                        seals, water marks, form fields, letter heads, or incipits, are not
                        considered part of the proposed correspondence description. These aspects
                        are not necessarily correspondence-specific but rather characteristic for
                        manuscripts in general and are thus best encoded within <gi>msDesc</gi>.</p>
                    <p>As this proposal deals with the <emph>meta data</emph> of correspondence,
                        aspects relating to correspondence-specific transcriptional encoding within
                            <gi>text</gi>, e.g. with <gi>postscript</gi>, <gi>opener</gi>,
                            <gi>closer</gi>, or <gi>signed</gi>, are not considered.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Implementation of the correspondence description</head>
                <p>The <gi>ct:correspDesc</gi> element provides a detailed description of
                    correspondence-specific metadata. The <gi>ct:correspDesc</gi> element focuses on
                    the communicative function of correspondence, i.e. sender, addressee,
                    transmission. It is provided as a supplement to the physical description of a
                    correspondence object which is to be encoded within the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. The
                    description is organized by the following elements 
                    <specList>
                        <specDesc key="sender"/>
                        <specDesc key="addressee"/>
                        <specDesc key="placeSender"/>
                        <specDesc key="placeAddressee"/>
                        <specDesc key="dateSender"/>
                        <specDesc key="dateAddressee"/>
                        <specDesc key="transmission"/>
                        <specDesc key="context"/>
                        <specDesc key="correspClass" atts="scheme"/>
                    </specList>
                </p>
                <p>These elements are all members of a model class called model.correspDescPart;
                    additional features may be defined by defining new elements and adding them to 
                    that class.</p>
                <p>A simple example might be encoded as follows: 
                    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="en">

                    facilitating the encoding of several entities of each feature provided that they
                    all belong to the same communication process. Hence, it is possible to differentiate between the intended and the actual (place of) addressee with the <att>type</att> attribute. 
                    In other cases, the respective elements are simply repeated. See for example the postcard of the gathered philologists in Prague to their colleague Seuffert in Graz on the occasion of the first informal <soCalled>Germanistenabend</soCalled> which features several <gi>ct:sender</gi> elements with one entry each:

                    <head>Actors, places and dates of correspondence</head>
                    <p>The very basic information about correspondence consists of the participating actors, their respective locations and dates (of writing/sending and reception). While there is a semantice difference between the sender of a message and the author of the corresponding text, in most cases those two will be identical. To reduce the redundancy of markup and error-proneness, <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html#SAIE">standard linking mechanisms</ref> can be applied to connect the <gi>author</gi> element within <gi>titleStmt</gi> to the appropriate <gi>ct:sender</gi> element.

                        In other cases (cf. the example of collaborative authorship above), there might as well be a clear distinction of the intellectual author of the text and the sender of the message, be it in disguise or frankly. Examples include pre-formulated greeting cards, forced dictated messages, or copied love letters. <!--In such cases, the genuine author is encoded as <gi>author</gi> within <gi>titleStmt</gi>, as usual.-->

It is possible to differentiate those places further with the <att>type</att> attribute, e.g. to distinguish the intended place of the addressee (as noted on the address) from the actual place of reception; or to capture several places of writing when the letter was produced over several days at several places. Where applicable, these names can be encoded in more detail with elements provided by the <ident type="module">namesdates</ident> module described in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html">13 Names, Dates, People, and Places</ref>. If an (external) placeography is present or authority files are available it is also highly recommended to identify those places via unique URIs.

                        machine etc. The <gi>ct:transmission</gi> element therefor in some respect is

                    <p>The exact position of a piece of correspondence as an act of communication within a communication continuum is a defining feature. This position between a preceding and a following message is encoded within <gi>ct:context</gi>. The evalution of the exact position, the <foreign xml:lang="de">Korrespondenzstelle</foreign>, might differ between projects due to constraints of (un)available material or different concepts, e.g. all known letters between person A and B across several repositories vs just the letters <emph>from</emph> person A <emph>to</emph> person B of <emph>one</emph> collection in <emph>one</emph> repository. For the encoding of the previous and following pieces of correspondence, <gi>ref</gi> or <gi>ptr</gi> elements may be used with pointing attributes or <gi>p</gi> for a more general description, as follows:

                        The classification of correspondence (according to external or project specific schemes) can be achieved by employing the standard mechanisms of text classification as described in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD43">2.4.3 The Text Classification</ref>. 
                        However, it might be desirable to capture the object- and/or eventlike nature of correspondence in situ and to merge the textual and contextual information with data about the physical appearance.
                        For this purpose the <gi>ct:correspClass</gi> element provides a simple means to collect these features:
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="en">
                            <ct:correspClass>
                                <term>picture postcard</term>
                                <term>signed personally</term>
                                <term>without envelope</term>
                            </ct:correspClass>
                        </egXML>
                        The proper place for the detailed description of the <soCalled>materiality</soCalled> of the correspondence object(s) and possible attachments is still the <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element (and probably <gi>msDesc</gi>), nevertheless it is possible to extract simple oppositions to facilitate processing of this information (e.g. 'without envelope'). These subject terms can either be according to a private scheme or by reference to some external classification system as used in library and documentation work in which case the <att>scheme</att> attribute should identify the according system by its URI. 
                        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:lang="de">

        <p>No particular syntax is proposed for the values of the <att>key</att> attribute, since

          a situation, a preferable approach for magic tokens which follows standard practice 
          on the Web is to use a <att>ref</att> attribute whose value is a tag URI as defined in

    <p>ISO 12620:2009 is a standard describing the data model and procedures for a Data
      Category Registry (DCR). Data categories are defined as elementary descriptors in a

      unique Peristent IDentifier (PID), i.e., an URI. Linguistic resources or preferably
      their schemas that make use of data categories from a DCR should refer to them using
      this PID. For XML-based resources, like TEI documents, ISO 12620:2009 normative
      Annex A gives a small Data Category Reference XML vocabulary (also available online

It is generally good practice to specify xml:lang at the highest

and that a single TEI document may contain texts in many languages.</p>

    <p>The values for this attribute are language <soCalled>tags</soCalled> as defined in <ref target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</ref>. Currently BCP 47 comprises RFC 4646
      and RFC 4647; over time, other IETF documents may succeed these as the best current practice.</p>
    <p>A <soCalled>language tag</soCalled>, per BCP 47, is assembled from a sequence of components
      or <term>subtags</term> separated by the hyphen character (<mentioned>-</mentioned>, U+002D).
      The tag is made of the following subtags, in the following order. Every subtag except the
      first is optional. If present, each occurs only once, except the fourth and fifth components
      (variant and extension), which are repeatable. <list type="gloss"><label>language</label><item>The IANA-registered code for the language. This is almost always the same as the ISO
          639 2-letter language code if there is one. The list of available registered language
          subtags can be found at <ptr target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry"/>. It is recommended
          that this code be written in lower case.</item><label>script</label><item>The ISO 15924 code for the script. These codes consist of 4 letters, and it is
          recommended they be written with an initial capital, the other three letters in lower
          case. The canonical list of codes is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, and is
          available at <ptr target="http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html"/>. The IETF
          recommends this code be omitted unless it is necessary to make a distinction you need.</item><label>region</label><item>Either an ISO 3166 country code or a UN M.49 region code that is registered with IANA
          (not all such codes are registered, e.g. UN codes for economic groupings or codes for
          countries for which there is already an ISO 3166 2-letter code are not registered). The
          former consist of 2 letters, and it is recommended they be written in upper case. The list
          of codes can be found at <ptr target="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/index.html"/>. The latter consist of 3 digits; the list of codes can be found at <ptr target="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm"/>.</item><label>variant</label><item>An IANA-registered variation. These codes <quote rend="quoted">are used to indicate
            additional, well-recognized variations that define a language or its dialects that are
            not covered by other available subtags</quote>.</item><label>extension</label><item>An extension has the format of a single letter followed by a hyphen followed by
          additional subtags. These exist to allow for future extension to BCP 47, but as of this
          writing no such extensions are in use.</item><label>private use</label><item>An extension that uses the initial subtag of the single letter
          <mentioned>x</mentioned> (i.e., starts with <code>x-</code>) has no meaning except as
          negotiated among the parties involved. These should be used with great care, since they
          interfere with the interoperability that use of RFC 4646 is intended to promote. In order
          for a document that makes use of these subtags to be TEI-conformant, a corresponding
            <gi>language</gi> element must be present in the TEI header.</item></list>
      </p>
    <p>There are two exceptions to the above format. First, there are language tags in the <ref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">IANA registry</ref> that
      do not match the above syntax, but are present because they have been
      <soCalled>grandfathered</soCalled> from previous specifications.</p>
    <p>Second, an entire language tag can consist of only a private use subtag. These tags start
      with <code>x-</code>, and do not need to follow any further rules established by the IETF and
      endorsed by these Guidelines. Like all language tags that make use of private use subtags, the
      language in question must be documented in a corresponding <gi>language</gi> element in the
      TEI header.</p>
    <p>Examples include <list type="gloss"><label><val>sn</val></label><item>Shona</item><label><val>zh-TW</val></label><item>Taiwanese</item><label><val>zh-Hant-HK</val></label><item>Chinese written in traditional script as used in Hong Kong</item><label><val>en-SL</val></label><item>English as spoken in Sierra Leone</item><label><val>pl</val></label><item>Polish</item><label><val>es-MX</val></label><item>Spanish as spoken in Mexico</item><label><val>es-419</val></label><item>Spanish as spoken in Latin America</item></list>

      suite de composants ou de <term>sous-étiquettes</term> reliés par un trait d'union
        (<mentioned>-</mentioned>, U+002D). L'étiquette est composée des sous-étiquettes suivantes,
      dans l'ordre indiqué. Chaque sous-étiquette est facultative, à l'exception de la première.
      Chacune ne peut avoir qu'une occurrence, sauf les quatrième et cinquième (variante
      et extension), qui sont répétables. <list type="gloss"><label>langue</label><item>Code de langue enregistré par l'IANA. Il est presque toujours identique au code

          beaucoup de prudence, car elles interfèrent avec l'interopérabilité que l'utilisation de
          la norme RFC 4646 vise à promouvoir. Pour qu'un document qui utilise ces sous-étiquettes soit

      qui ne correspondent pas à la syntaxe ci-dessus, mais qui sont présents car ils ont été
        <soCalled>hérités</soCalled> de spécifications antérieures.</p>
    <p>En second lieu, une étiquette complète de langue peut consister seulement en une sous-étiquette d'usage privé. Ces étiquettes commencent par <code>x-</code> ; il n'est pas
      nécessaire qu'elles suivent les autres règles établies par l'IETF et acceptées par les présents 
      Principes directeurs. Comme toutes les étiquettes de langue qui utilisent des sous-étiquettes d'usage
      privé, la langue en question doit être documentée dans un élément correspondant <gi>language</gi> dans l'en-tête TEI.</p>

        <p>If the milestone marks the beginning of a piece of text not present in the reference

          the text which follows, until the next <gi>milestone</gi> tag for the edition in question
          is encountered.</p>

    <p>Because the children of a  <gi>choice</gi> element all

    <p>This element should be used for deletion of shorter sequences of text, typically single words
      or phrases. The <gi>delSpan</gi> element should be used for longer sequences of text, for
      those containing structural subdivisions, and for those containing overlapping additions and
      deletions.</p>
    <p>The text deleted must be at least partially legible in order for the encoder to be able to
      transcribe it (unless it is restored in a <gi>supplied</gi> tag). Illegible or lost text within a 
      deletion may be marked using the <gi>gap</gi> tag to signal that text is present but has not
      been transcribed, or is no longer visible. Attributes on the <gi>gap</gi>
      element may be used to indicate how much text is omitted, the reason for omitting it, etc. If
      text is not fully legible, the <gi>unclear</gi> element (available when using the additional
      tagset for transcription of primary sources) should be used to signal the areas of text which
      cannot be read with confidence in a similar way.</p>
    <p>Degrees of uncertainty over what can still be read, or whether a deletion was intended may be
      indicated by use of the <gi>certainty</gi> element (see <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CE.html#CE">21. </ref>).</p>
    <p>There is a clear distinction in the TEI between <gi>del</gi>
    and <gi>surplus</gi> on the one hand and <gi>gap</gi> or
    <gi>unclear</gi> on the other. <gi>del</gi> indicates a
    deletion present in the source being transcribed, which states
     the author's or a later scribe's intent to cancel or remove
     text. <gi>surplus</gi> indicates material present in the source
     being transcribed which  should have been so
     deleted, but which is not in fact. <gi>gap</gi> or <gi>unclear</gi>, by contrast, signal an
     editor's or encoder's decision to omit something or their
     inability to read the source text.
    See  sections <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHOM">11.3.1.7. </ref> and <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHCOMB">11.3.3.2. </ref> for the relationship between these and other

        <p>The <att>type</att> attribute is provided for the sake of those who wish to
                    classify abbreviations at their point of occurrence; this may be useful in some
                    circumstances, though usually the same abbreviation will have the same type in
                    all occurrences. As the sample values make clear, abbreviations may be
                    classified by the method used to construct them, the method of writing them, or
                    the referent of the term abbreviated; the typology used is up to the encoder and
                    should be carefully planned to meet the needs of the expected use. For a

            the stolen goods, [if he is] over twelve years and [if the value of the goods is] over
            eightpence. <list type="ordered"><item n="1.1">And if anyone does spare one, he is to pay for the thief with his
                wergild — and the thief is to be no nearer a settlement on that account — or to
                clear himself by an oath of that amount.</item><item n="1.2">If, however, he [the thief] wishes to defend himself or to escape, he is

                then be redeemed with 120 shillings; and the kindred are to stand surety for him
                that he will desist for ever.</item><item n="1.4">And if he steals after that, they are to pay for him with his wergild,

                whether to the king or to him to whom it rightly belongs; and everyone of those who
                supported him is to pay 120 shillings to the king as a fine.</item></list>

            no justice can be obtained, that one should order their kindred to fetch back such a
            person to justice and to find him a lord in public meeting. <list type="ordered"><item n="2.1">And if they then will not, or cannot, produce him on that appointed day,

            his guilty man, so that the king is appealed to, is to repay the value of the goods and
            120 shillings to the king; and he who appeals to the king before he demands justice as
            often as he ought, is to pay the same fine as the other would have done, if he had
            refused him justice. <list type="ordered"><item n="3.1">And the lord who is an accessory to a theft by his slave, and it becomes
                known about him, is to forfeit the slave and be liable to his wergild on the first
                occasionp if he does it more often, he is to be liable to pay all that he owns.</item><item n="3.2">And likewise any of the king's treasurers or of our reeves, who has been
                an accessory of thieves who have committed theft, is to liable to the same.</item></list>

        <p>In modern texts, notes are usually anchored by means of explicit footnote or endnote
          symbols. An explicit indication of the phrase or line annotated may however be used
          instead (e.g. <q>page 218, lines 3–4</q>). The <att>anchored</att> attribute indicates
          whether any explicit location is given, whether by symbol or by prose cross-reference. The
          value <val>true</val> indicates that such an explicit location is indicated in the copy
          text; the value <val>false</val> indicates that the copy text does not indicate a specific
          place of attachment for the note. If the specific symbols used in the copy text at the
          location the note is anchored are to be recorded, use the <att>n</att> attribute.</p>

          l'expression ou de la ligne annotée peut cependant être employée (par exemple <q>page 218,
            lignes 3–4</q>). L'attribut <att>anchored</att> indique si un emplacement est donné

      dans la page, ou une autre unité de mesure appropriée. Cet élément est prévu pour être employé
      pour marquer un saut de ligne sur un manuscrit ou sur une page imprimée, à l’endroit où il se
      survient; on n’utilisera pas de balisage structurel comme une succession de vers (pour lequel
      l’élément <gi>l</gi> est disponible) sauf dans le cas où des blocs structurés ne peuvent pas

    <p>Where an author is unknown or unspecified, this element may contain
text such as <mentioned>Unknown</mentioned> or

in use, it may also contain detailed tagging of the names used for people, organizations or

as valuable in his time... As a food, the apple cannot be considered

however a useful adjunct to other kinds of food, and, when cooked, is
esteemed as slightly laxative.</p>

	  <p>Good database design involves the acquisition and deployment of
skills which have a wider relevance to the educational process.
From a set of more or less instinctive rules of thumb a formal
discipline or "methodology" of database design has evolved.
Applying that methodology can be of great benefit to a very wide
range of academic subjects: it requires fundamental skills of
abstraction and generalisation and it provides a simple mechanism
whereby complex ideas and information structures can be
represented and manipulated, even without the use of a computer.

    <p>The <att>target</att> attribute should only be used to point to elements that contain or
      indicate a transcription of the locus being described, as in the first example above. To
      associate a <gi>locus</gi> element with a page image or other comparable representation, the
      global <att>facs</att> attribute should be used instead, as shown in the second example. Use
      of the <att>target</att> attribute to indicate an image is strongly deprecated. The
        <att>facs</att> attribute may be used to indicate one or more image files, as above, or
      alternatively it may point to one or more appropriate XML elements, such as the
        <gi>surface</gi>, <gi>zone</gi> element, <gi>graphic</gi>, or <gi>binaryObject</gi>

        <title>Guan-ben</title>
        <filiation>
          <p>The "Guan-ben" was widely current among mathematicians in the
    Qing dynasty, and "Zhao Qimei version" was also read.  It is
    therefore difficult to know the correct filiation path to follow.
    The study of this era is much indebted to Li Di.  We explain the
    outline of his conclusion here.  Kong Guangsen 
    (1752-1786)(17) was from the same town as Dai Zhen, so he obtained
    "Guan-ben" from him and studied it(18).  Li Huang  (d. 1811)
    (19) took part in editing Si Ku Quan Shu, so he must have had
    "Guan-ben".  Then Zhang Dunren (1754-1834) obtained this version,
    and studied "Da Yan Zong Shu Shu" (The General Dayan
    Computation).  He wrote Jiu Yi Suan Shu (Mathematics
    Searching for One, 1803) based on this version of Shu Xue Jiu
    Zhang (20).</p>
          <p>One of the most important persons in restoring our knowledge
   concerning the filiation of these books was Li Rui (1768(21)
   -1817)(see his biography).  ... only two volumes remain of this
    manuscript, as far as chapter 6 (chapter 3 part 2) p.13, that is,
    question 2 of "Huan Tian San Ji" (square of three loops),
    which later has been lost.</p>

        <p>There are lacunae in three places in this
manuscript. After 14v two
leaves has been cut out and narrow strips leaves remains in the spine. After
68v one gathering is missing and after 101v at least one gathering of 8 leaves
has been lost. </p>
        <p>Several leaves are damaged with tears or holes or have a
irregular shape. Some of the damages do not allow the lines to be of full
length and they are apparently older than the script. There are tears on fol.
2r-v, 9r-v, 10r-v, 15r-18v, 19r-v, 20r-22v, 23r-v, 24r-28v, 30r-v, 32r-35v,

the corner has been torn off. Several leaves are in a bad condition due to
moist and wear, and have become dark, bleached or
wrinkled. </p>
        <p>The script has been
touched up in the 17th century with black ink. The touching up on the following
fols. was done by 
<name>Bishop Brynjólf Sveinsson</name>: 1v, 3r, 4r, 5r,
6v, 8v,9r, 10r, 14r, 14v, 22r,30v, 36r-52v, 72v, 77r,78r,103r, 104r,. An
AM-note says according to the lawman 
<name>Sigurður Björnsson</name> that the rest of the
touching up was done by himself and another lawman 
<name>Sigurður Jónsson</name>. 
<name>Sigurður Björnsson</name> did the touching up
on the following fols.: 46v, 47r, 48r, 49r-v, 50r, 52r-v. 
<name>Sigurður Jónsson</name> did the rest of the

    <p>If both <att>when-iso</att> and <att>dur-iso</att> are specified, the values should be interpreted as indicating a span of time by its
            starting time (or date) and duration. That is, <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date when-iso="2007-06-01" dur-iso="P8D"/></egXML> indicates the same time period as <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date when-iso="2007-06-01/P8D"/></egXML>

    <p>In providing a <soCalled>regularized</soCalled> form, no claim is made that the form in the source text is incorrect; the regularized form
            is simply that chosen as the main form for purposes of unifying variant forms under a single heading.</p>

C'est à dire, <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date when-iso="2007-06-01" dur-iso="P8D"/></egXML> indique la même période temporelle que <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><date when-iso="2007-06-01/P8D"/></egXML>

    <p>En fournissant une forme dite "régularisée", il n'est rien affirmé sur la correction ou l'incorrection de la forme dans le texte source ;

    <p>As with other culturally-constructed traits such as
    age, the way in which this concept is described in different
    cultural contexts may vary. The normalizing attributes are
    provided only as an optional means of simplifying that variety to 
    one or more external standards for purposes of interoperability,
    or project-internal taxonomies for consistency, and should not be used where that is
    inappropriate or unhelpful. The content of the element may be used to describe
    the intended concept in more detail, using plain text. </p>

    <p>Where there is confusion between <gi>trait</gi> and <gi>state</gi> the more general purpose
      element <gi>state</gi> should be used even for unchanging characteristics. If you wish to
      distinguish between characteristics that are generally perceived to be time-bound states and
      those assumed to be fixed traits, then <gi>trait</gi> is available for the more static of
      these. The <gi>state</gi> element encodes characteristics which are sometimes assumed to
      change, often at specific times or over a date range, whereas the <gi>trait</gi> elements are
      used to record characteristics, such as eye-colour, which are less subject to change. Traits are typically, but not necessarily, 
      independent of the volition or action of the holder.</p>

        <p>In this example, a <gi>place</gi> element containing information about the city of 
           London is linked with two <gi>person</gi> elements in a literary personography. 
           This correspondence represents a slightly looser relationship than the one in the 
           preceding example; there is no sense in which an allegorical character could be 
           substituted for the physical city, or vice versa, but there is obviously a correspondence 
           between them.
